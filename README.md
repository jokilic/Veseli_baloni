# Veseli baloni

Veseli baloni is a simple game made in **Unity**.
It features baloons that can be popped.
Online highscores are available so you can compete with your friends and see who is the master of  Veseli baloni.

### Game can be downloaded from [HERE](https://github.com/jokilic/Veseli_baloni/releases/download/1.0/veseli_baloni.apk).

## Three modes of play

### Casual mode

You can play until you're sick of the game.
There is no Game Over, the baloons just keep coming and you can pop as long as you want.

### Normal mode

Normal mode is a bit different.
The baloons are smaller and if you miss 5 baloons, it's game over.

### Tony mode

Tony is my friend from college.
Everytime you ask him 'Where are you', he won't tell you, he will send some weird photo of himself.
While I was working on this game, I realised I have a lot of his photos in my gallery, so I decided to make him a part of the game.
The game rules are identical to Casual mode.
Pop Tonys heads for as long as you like!

## Highscores

I have implemented online highscores for every mode.
Check if you have what it takes to be at the number one.
